			h1.ui.centered.header About Secret Hitler
			p Application designed and developed from the original board game by #[a(href="http://www.TwoLongOs.com") Chris Ozols].  Due to a fairly complicated UI and text-driven gameplay this application is not mobile-optimized, but should work OK on mobile devices in theory.  Source code available at #[a(href="//github.com/cozuya/secret-hitler") github].  Bugs/issues?  Use #[a(href="//goo.gl/forms/IxDi9f1fKyGhefDx2") this webform] or open an issue on github.
