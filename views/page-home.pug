					p Secret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930's Germany. Players are secretly divided into two teams - liberals and fascists. Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before itâ€™s too late.

					p 11-12-2016 alpha begins.  Issues/bugs can be reported at #[a(href="//goo.gl/forms/IxDi9f1fKyGhefDx2") this link.] or open a github issue.
					p Version 0.1.9 released 4-22-2017
					h4 New version
					p New feature: private games
					ul 
						li When making a game, select the "private game" slider and you will be prompted for the game's password
						li Players can only be seated in a private game if they enter the correct password.
						li While not totally private (observers can still watch), observers cannot chat.
					p Bug fixes
					ul
						li Fix (I hope) to the "11 player game" crash bug, as the way players are seated was redone to be more safe.  This is not easy to reproduce so please update me if it still exists.
						li Fix to the gamechat in 9 and 10 player games not getting the other fascists right, thanks to pull request from @jbasrai on github.
					p Next release: private messaging (outside of in-progress games).  I realize that without that private games aren't super helpful, so that will be my next priority for this project.
