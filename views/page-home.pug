					p Secret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930's Germany. Players are secretly divided into two teams - liberals and fascists. Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before itâ€™s too late.

					p Version 0.2.2 "mauve" released 5-18-2017
					p Small patch again to remove the completed/abandoned games from the game list on the left sidebar.  Effectively new games are deleted 30 minutes after they are started, and the system checks for those games every 5 minutes.
					h3 CRASH FIXES
					p Well orchid was very effective on positive uptime.  I'm only see 2 places its been crashing today, and I'm attempting to address both in mauve.  This is almost looking like a real application..
					p Version 0.2.1 "orchid" released 5-17-2017
					p Small patch to attempt to address the crashing problems in a new way.  Also made the claim system much less verbose by request.  Feedback is great thanks.
					p Version 0.2.0 "violet" released 5-16-2017
					h3 New feature: automated claim system
					p After the following actions:
					ul
						li President receives 3 policies and chancellor completes his or her discard
						li Chancellor receives 2 policies and completes his or her discard
						li President peeks at the top 3 policies
						li President examines party loyalty
					p A glowing "C" will show up in the lower right corner of chat for those players.
					div(style="text-align: center")
						img(src="images/claim-button.png", style="margin-top: 0")
					p Click that, and the chat window will be overlaid with a new modal.
					img(src="images/claim-modal.png", style="margin-top: 0; text-align: center")
					P Click your action (or click the C again to dismiss) and a new type of chat will appear, informing players about what you say happened.  You have until the next election to do this action.

						li (#34) Fix to too long status bar text wrapping to next line that causes the input bar to get pushed down (finally).

					p Next up: fix to left sidebar problems of being sorted incorrectly and games not disappearing, and then working on the stats page which will be fun.
