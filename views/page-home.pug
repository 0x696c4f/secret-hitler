					p Secret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930's Germany. Players are secretly divided into two teams - liberals and fascists. Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before itâ€™s too late.

					p Version 0.2.1 "orchid" released 5-17-2017
					p Small patch to attempt to address the crashing problems in a new way.  Also made the claim system much less verbose by request.  Feedback is great thanks.
					p Version 0.2.0 "violet" released 5-16-2017
					h3 New feature: automated claim system
					p After the following actions:
					ul
						li President receives 3 policies and chancellor completes his or her discard
						li Chancellor receives 2 policies and completes his or her discard
						li President peeks at the top 3 policies
						li President examines party loyalty
					p A glowing "C" will show up in the lower right corner of chat for those players.
					div(style="text-align: center")
						img(src="images/claim-button.png", style="margin-top: 0")
					p Click that, and the chat window will be overlaid with a new modal.
					img(src="images/claim-modal.png", style="margin-top: 0; text-align: center")
					P Click your action (or click the C again to dismiss) and a new type of chat will appear, informing players about what you say happened.  You have until the next election to do this action.

					p Let me know if you like/hate this, and any issues or requests about it.
					h3 CRASH FIX
					p I feel like I owe some explanation about these.  The gist of it is, shockingly, an asynchronous application that takes in tons of requests per minute is hard to cover all edge cases for.  I know where it crashes, and I've been slowly addressing them, but reproduction steps are very hard!  The main crash bug (right now) involves the system right after an election passing trying to assign chancellor to a player but cannot find the pendingchancellor player.. which should always exist if it got that far!  So anyways this patch includes a "defensive" way to prevent those crashes - there is some chance it will work perfectly, there is some chance it will break everything.  I will be monitoring and will revert/fix appropriately.  Please continue to use the bug form.
					h4 Bug fixes in 0.2.0
					ul
						li (#26) Fix to next president being wrong person after a special election where seat #1 was picked (finally).
						li (#34) Fix to too long status bar text wrapping to next line that causes the input bar to get pushed down (finally).
						li Fix to width of generalchat.
					p Next up: fix to left sidebar problems of being sorted incorrectly and games not disappearing, and then working on the stats page which will be fun.
