Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before itâ€™s too late.

					ul

						li A player who has been whitelisted will be able to get seated in this game without being prompted for the password.
						li This should prevent griefers/trolls from ruining games, without the need for an abusable private messaging system.  Please do not use this to exclude new players.

					ul
						li CRASH FIXES - @jbasrai has identified and resolved 2 scenarios, I am diligent about wanting to bring this project to stability and will be analyzing logs etc.  Please bear with us.
						li Thanks to a bug report, a issue has been fixed with the "investigate loyalty" power - it can no longer be used twice on the same player.
					p Next up: automated claim system, and further investigation/fixes of crash problems.
