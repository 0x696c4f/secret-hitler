					p Secret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930's Germany. Players are secretly divided into two teams - liberals and fascists. Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before itâ€™s too late.

						li Added 2 new modes to creategame: disable player chat (good for voice-only games) and disable gamechat (and name colors) - you're on your own with this one as the game will not prompt you with what you saw during actions, so more like a tabletop game.
						li Fixed bug with special election.
						li Next on horizon: automated claim system.  After that I'm redoing the UI (optionally inside of player settings) to look more like a "game table".
