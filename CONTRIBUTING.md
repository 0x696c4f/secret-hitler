Hello and thanks for considering contributing to this project. Any accepted PR will be rewarded with a special contributor status on the site and orange color!
I only have the following guidelines:

1. Before working on a feature, a) make sure its an open, not "suggested" issue on the github issue page and b) it is unassigned. If you start working on
	something, assign it to yourself, or ask me to, not sure about github permissions.

2. Your code should pass lint.

3. Your code should use prettier with the following options: use-tabs - true, single-quote - true, print-width: 160.

4. If you make something, please commit to supporting it. If there's issues raised on a feature you've made, please make sure you take care of it.
