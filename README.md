secret-hitler
======================

Secret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930's Germany. Players are secretly divided into two teams - liberals and fascists. Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before itâ€™s too late.

## Installation ##

Install node v6.x.

Install mongodb, have it in your path.

> git clone https://github.com/cozuya/secret-hitler.git

> cd secret-hitler

> npm i -g gulp nodemon

> npm i

At this point you may receive an error regarding node-sass so you'll need to do

> npm rebuild node-sass

For installation on windows, you may need to do a few extra steps if you are getting node-gyp errors, specifically installing the required MS programs referred to on node-gyp's github, and then possibly doing:

> set GYP_MSVS_VERSION=2013

> npm i --msvs_version=2013

instead of the npm install found above.

## Running in dev mode ##

start mongo:

> npm run db

start server:

> npm start

build assets (first time only):

> gulp build

start development task runner:

> gulp

navigate to: http://localhost:8080

You'll most likely need a browser extension such as Chrome's Multilogin to have multiple sessions on the same browser.  No, incognito will not work.
