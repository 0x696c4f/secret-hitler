Hello and thanks for considering contributing to this project.  I only have three guidelines:

1. Before working on a feature, a) make sure its an open, not "potential" issue on the github issue page and b) it is unassigned.

2. Your code should pass lint.

3. Your code should use prettier with the following options: use-tabs - true, single-quote - true, print-width: 160.
